This directory contains canned situations for testing saiph's reaction
to them.  They are useful for testing behavior in obscure or late-game
situations.  To use these, you will need to build and install a custom
NetHack with patches/situation.patch applied; then, start saiph with
NHSITUATIONFILE=/full/path/to/whatever.t in the environment.


The following situations are currently available:

buc_lizard.t: BUC-testing of lizard corpses (caused segfaults in past)

locked_shop_1.t: Test "Closed for inventory" handling.

locked_shop_2.t: Like 1, but the corridor comes in sideways, so the
    bot must know not to kick down doors from diagonals.

vault.t: Escaping a vault

wand_on_engr.t: You find a wand on top of an engraved message
    (rawrmage reported a #quit in this situation)


If you want to write your own situation files, the format is very
simple although not very easy to use.  The situation is interpreted
as a list of commands to be run after setting up the dungeon and
the character.

In general, a situation will contain commands to set relevant
properties of the character, and additionally will either set up a
custom dungeon level or will transport the character to a defined
special level.  These commands are available:

Map section commands:

altar X Y ALIGN

Place an altar (1=law, 0=neu, -1=cha) at the given position.

Sets initial location of the character.

Sets up a corridor.  Should be used after all room and door
definitions.

door X Y TYPE SECRET

Places a door.  Must be used immediately after the room that the door
belongs to (it is not possible at this time to set up a freestanding
door).  TYPEs are 0=no door, 1=broken, 2=open, 4=closed, 8=locked,
20=closed+trapped, 24=locked+trapped.  SECRET is 1 or 0.

used after all other map section commands.
